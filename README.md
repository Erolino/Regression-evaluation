# Regression-evaluation 
## Plugin for visualization of quality of regression models in a business context
#### - The Plugin gets actual values and predicted values
#### - it then calculates the errors
#### - the discrete option visualizes for distinct error values, how many predictions were too low, too high or exactly in the desired margin. This allow business stakeholders to decide what error is acceptable, given the number of predictions in the margin
#### - the continuous option visualizes in general the performance of the model: The bigger the area between the curves - the better the model
